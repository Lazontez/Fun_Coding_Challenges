/**
 * ğŸ§ª Problem: First Failing Build (Binary Search)
 * 
 * You're given a function `isFailingBuild(buildNumber)` which returns a boolean:
 * - true if the build is failing
 * - false if the build is passing
 * 
 * Once a build fails, all subsequent builds also fail.
 * 
 * Your task is to implement a function that returns the build number
 * of the **first failing build**.
 * 
 * ğŸ“¥ Input:
 * - n: total number of builds (an integer)
 * - isFailingBuild(buildNumber) is already defined.
 * 
 * ğŸ§¾ Output:
 * - Return the build number of the first failing build.
 * - It is guaranteed that at least one build is failing.
 * 
 * ğŸ§  Example:
 * isFailingBuild(3) â†’ false  
 * isFailingBuild(4) â†’ true  
 * isFailingBuild(5) â†’ true  
 * 
 * Input: n = 5  
 * Output: 4
