Interview Question:
Describe the difference between manual and automated testing?
When would you choose one over the other?

Answer:
Manual testing involves executing test cases manually without using automation tools, ensuring software meets requirements through human observation.
Itâ€™s best suited for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing.

Automated testing, on the other hand, uses scripts and tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress) to perform repetitive and regression tests efficiently.
It is ideal for large-scale applications requiring frequent testing, ensuring faster execution and consistency.

When to Choose One Over the Other:
- Manual Testing: When conducting exploratory, usability, or one-time tests that require human judgment.
- Automated Testing: When dealing with repetitive, regression, or performance testing where efficiency and scalability are crucial.
