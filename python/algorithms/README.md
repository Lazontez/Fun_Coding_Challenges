# FizzBuzz Challenge

## Problem Statement

Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

### Expected Input

No input is required; the program runs and prints the output.

### Expected Output

The program should output numbers from 1 to 100, replacing certain values based on the rules:

```python
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...

```
